# Section 6: Service Delivery Approach

## 6.1 Discovery and Problem Definition Approach

### AI Readiness Assessment Methodology

We begin every AI engagement with a structured discovery process designed to answer three questions:
1. **Is AI the right solution?** — Not every problem needs AI; we honestly assess fit
2. **Is the organisation ready?** — Data, processes, and culture must support AI adoption
3. **What does success look like?** — Clear, measurable outcomes before we build

**Discovery Framework:**

| Phase | Activities | Deliverables |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Stakeholder Alignment | Interviews with business sponsors, technical teams, end users | Problem definition document, success criteria |
| Data Landscape Assessment | Data source inventory, quality evaluation, access review | Data readiness scorecard, gap analysis |
| Technical Feasibility | Review of integration points, infrastructure, constraints | Feasibility assessment, risk register |
| Opportunity Sizing | Estimate of value, effort, and timeline | Business case with ROI framework |

### Stakeholder Engagement Approach

- **Executive Sponsors** — Align on strategic objectives and success metrics
- **Technical Teams** — Understand integration requirements and constraints
- **End Users** — Validate problem definition and gather workflow context
- **Compliance/Security** — Identify regulatory and policy requirements early

### Problem Framing and Success Criteria

We define success criteria that are:
- **Measurable** — Quantitative metrics wherever possible
- **Time-bound** — Clear evaluation timeline
- **Stakeholder-agreed** — Documented consensus before proceeding
- **Incrementally achievable** — Milestones from POC to production

## 6.2 Delivery Methodology

### Pilot → Validate → Scale Framework

We do not believe in big-bang AI deployments. Our methodology emphasises learning through controlled progression:

**Stage 1: Proof of Concept (POC)**
- Duration: 2-4 weeks
- Goal: Demonstrate technical feasibility
- Success gate: Technical viability confirmed, key risks identified

**Stage 2: Proof of Value (POV)**
- Duration: 4-8 weeks
- Goal: Validate business value with real users and data
- Success gate: Measurable improvement vs. baseline, user acceptance

**Stage 3: Production Deployment**
- Duration: 8-12 weeks (varies by complexity)
- Goal: Scalable, monitored, supported production system
- Success gate: Operational readiness, knowledge transfer complete

### Agile Delivery Practices

- **Two-week sprints** with defined deliverables
- **Daily standups** during active development (async-friendly for remote work)
- **Sprint demos** showing working functionality to stakeholders
- **Retrospectives** for continuous process improvement

### Proof-of-Value Design

For AI projects, we design POVs that:
- Use real (not synthetic) data from the client environment
- Involve actual end users, not just technical evaluators
- Measure against pre-defined success criteria
- Surface integration and operational challenges early

## 6.3 AI Model and Solution Lifecycle Management

### Model Versioning and Experiment Tracking

- **Version control** for all model artifacts (code, configurations, weights)
- **Experiment tracking** documenting hyperparameters, training data, and results
- **Model registry** for production deployment management
- **Reproducibility** ensuring any model version can be regenerated

### Monitoring and Drift Detection

| Monitoring Type | What We Track | Alert Triggers |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Technical | Latency, errors, resource usage | Performance degradation |
| Data | Input distribution, feature values | Data drift from training distribution |
| Model | Prediction confidence, outcome distribution | Accuracy degradation, concept drift |
| Business | Downstream metrics, user feedback | Business KPI impact |

### Retraining Triggers and Feedback Loops

- **Scheduled retraining** based on data freshness requirements
- **Triggered retraining** when drift detection thresholds exceeded
- **Feedback incorporation** from user corrections and outcome data
- **A/B testing** for model improvements before full deployment

### Handoff and Operational Readiness

Before handoff to operations, we ensure:
- **Runbooks** documenting common operations and troubleshooting
- **Monitoring dashboards** in client's observability tooling
- **Incident procedures** for model failures or degradation
- **Training sessions** for operations and support teams

## 6.4 Responsible AI, Security, and Privacy Practices

### AI Ethics Framework

Our approach to responsible AI is informed by direct experience leading compliance programmes (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI) and applies those principles to AI systems:

**Bias Detection and Fairness:**
- Evaluate training data for representation gaps
- Test model outputs across demographic segments (where applicable)
- Document and disclose known limitations
- Regular fairness audits for production systems

**Transparency and Explainability:**
- Document model decision factors at appropriate level for stakeholders
- Provide explanations for individual predictions where impactful
- Disclose AI involvement in user-facing applications
- Maintain audit trails of AI decisions

### Data Privacy by Design

Drawing from GDPR and privacy programme experience:
- **Data minimisation** — Collect only what's needed for the AI objective
- **Purpose limitation** — Use data only for stated purposes
- **Retention policies** — Define and enforce data lifecycle
- **Privacy impact assessment** — Evaluate before deploying AI on personal data
- **Consent management** — Clear user consent for AI processing

### Security Architecture for AI Systems

- **Secure training pipelines** — Protected data handling during model development
- **Model serving security** — Authentication, authorisation, encryption in transit
- **Prompt injection prevention** — For generative AI applications
- **Adversarial robustness** — Testing for manipulation attempts
- **Access controls** — Least privilege for model and data access

### Government of Alberta Alignment

We understand Alberta Innovates operates within Government of Alberta frameworks:
- **Protected A/B classification** — Experience handling sensitive data appropriately
- **FOIP Act** — Awareness of freedom of information and privacy requirements
- **Canadian data residency** — Azure Canada regions, no cross-border data transfer

[**NEEDS DETAIL:** Confirm familiarity with specific GoA data classification and FOIP requirements]

# Section 7: Resourcing Model and Capacity

## 7.1 Typical Team Composition by Engagement Size

| Engagement Type | Team Size | Composition | Leadership |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Advisory / POC | 1-2 | Principal + specialist (if needed) | John Carpenter leads directly |
| Implementation | 3-5 | Principal + data engineer + ML engineer + BA | John Carpenter as architect, hands-on involvement |
| Enterprise Scale | 5-8 | Principal + full delivery team | John Carpenter as lead architect + scaled specialists |

**Key Differentiator:** In all engagement sizes, the Principal Consultant (John Carpenter) remains directly involved in architecture and key technical decisions. We do not hand off to junior resources after sales.

## 7.2 Onshore / Nearshore / Offshore Resources

**100% Canadian Delivery**

| Category | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Onshore (Alberta) | Principal Consultant based in Calgary; available for on-site work at Edmonton or Calgary Alberta Innovates facilities |
| Onshore (Canada) | Specialist subcontractors located across Canada |
| Nearshore | Not used |
| Offshore | Not used |

We do not use offshore resources. All work is performed by Canadian-based personnel.

## 7.3 In-House vs. Subcontractors

**Transparent Resourcing Model**

| Function | Resourcing | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Technical leadership & architecture | In-house (Principal) | Core value proposition |
| AI strategy & solution design | In-house (Principal) | Requires deep client context |
| ML engineering (specialised models) | Subcontracted | Access to specialists by model type |
| Data engineering (large-scale) | Subcontracted | Scale capacity as needed |
| Business analysis | In-house or subcontracted | Depends on engagement scope |
| Project management | In-house (Principal) | Maintains continuity |

**Subcontractor Vetting:**
- All subcontractors vetted for technical capability
- Security background check completion as required by engagement
- Signed confidentiality agreements
- Regular performance assessment

## 7.4 Resource Stability

**Small Firm Advantage**

Unlike large consulting firms that rotate resources based on bench availability and utilization targets, our model offers:

- **No bench rotation** — We don't pull resources to higher-priority clients
- **No bait-and-switch** — The person you meet in sales is the person who does the work
- **Named resource commitment** — Principal Consultant committed to engagement duration
- **Relationship continuity** — Single point of contact who knows the history

**Availability:**
- Principal Consultant maintains capacity for roster-based work
- Subcontractor relationships provide scaling flexibility
- Workload balanced to ensure responsiveness

## 7.5 Knowledge Transfer and Training Approach

**Documentation-First Delivery**

All engagements include:
- **Technical documentation** — Architecture decisions, configuration, integration points
- **Operational runbooks** — How to operate, monitor, and troubleshoot
- **User guides** — For end-users of AI-enabled systems

**Structured Knowledge Transfer:**
- **Working sessions** with client technical teams throughout delivery
- **Code walkthroughs** for custom development
- **Handoff meetings** at engagement conclusion
- **Video recordings** of complex procedures (optional)

**Training Delivery:**
- Workshop-style training for technical teams
- Executive briefings on AI capabilities and limitations
- End-user training for AI-enabled tools

[**NEEDS DETAIL:** Confirm specific training experience and workshop examples]

## Tax Breakdown

| Tax Type | Rate |
|----------|------|
| GST | 5% |
| HST | N/A |
| PST | N/A |
| State Tax | N/A |
| Other | N/A |

## Rate Notes

- Rates are for benchmarking purposes as specified in RFP Section 5.5
- Actual rates for specific Statements of Work may vary based on scope, duration, and complexity
- Volume discounts may be available for sustained engagements
- All rates include standard business expenses; travel expenses billed separately per RFP Section 7.0

**Rate Positioning:**

Our rates reflect senior-level expertise and our commitment to the "senior-first" delivery model:

- **AI/ML Architect** ($250/hr): CTO-level practitioner with 20+ years experience, not a consultant who learned AI last year. This rate reflects the strategic and hands-on value of having a single expert who can both design architecture and implement it.

- **Specialist Roles** ($145-195/hr): Senior practitioners with production experience, not junior resources learning on your project. Our subcontractor network consists of vetted professionals who meet the same quality bar.

**Value Proposition:**

While our rates position at the senior end of the Alberta market, clients receive:
- Direct access to experienced practitioners (no bait-and-switch)
- Faster time-to-value from experienced resources
- Lower total project cost through efficient delivery
- Reduced risk from proven methodologies and past delivery success
