# Suncorp: Fractional CTO & Cloud Migration

**Industry**: Property Appraisal / Public Sector
**Engagement**: Ongoing (2024–present)
**Role**: Fractional CTO (via Jot.digital)

## The Challenge

Suncorp is a property appraisal company serving school boards across Saskatchewan, with ~50 appraisers relying on a 15-20 year old on-premises infrastructure. The legacy systems—including the core PAC (Property Appraisal Computer) application, Sage financials, and Maximizer CRM—were costly to maintain ($30K/month), difficult to update, and created business continuity risk. The company needed to modernise without disrupting critical appraisal operations during peak assessment seasons.

## Our Approach

As Fractional CTO, I'm leading a comprehensive cloud migration and application modernisation initiative, moving Suncorp from legacy on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft Azure. The approach balances aggressive cost reduction with operational stability—ensuring appraisers can continue working while systems are migrated beneath them.

Key initiatives:
- **Azure Virtual Desktop Migration**: Moving all applications to Azure AVD, eliminating on-premises servers while maintaining familiar desktop experience for users
- **Application Modernisation**: Migrating PAC, PAC Admin, Industrial Import Tool, Sage, and Maximizer CRM to cloud-native hosting with modern authentication
- **Identity & Security**: Implementing Entra ID (Azure AD) to replace legacy authentication, eliminating 2 servers and improving security posture
- **Data Integration**: Building ETL pipelines via Azure Data Factory to connect Maximizer CRM with PAC database
- **DevOps Transformation**: Establishing CI/CD pipelines reducing deployment time from 1-2 weeks to 1-2 hours

## Key Deliverables

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Four Azure environments (dev, test, staging, production) fully deployed
- **Application Migration**: All core business applications running on Azure AVD
- **Modern Authentication**: Entra ID integration across all systems
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Comprehensive infrastructure monitoring with alerting
- **Training & Documentation**: Video tutorials and workflow documentation for user transition

## Impact

- **50% infrastructure cost reduction**: $30K/month → $15K (targeting $6K)
- **Deployment velocity**: 1-2 hours vs. 1-2 weeks previously
- **Server elimination**: 2+ on-premises servers decommissioned via Entra ID upgrade
- **Business continuity**: Zero disruption to appraisal operations during migration
- **Security posture**: Modern identity management replacing legacy authentication

## Technologies

Microsoft Azure, Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD), Entra ID, Azure Data Factory, SQL Server, CI/CD pipelines, DataDog monitoring, Sage ERP, Maximizer CRM
