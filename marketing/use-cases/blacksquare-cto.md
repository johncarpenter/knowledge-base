# BlackSquare Inc: CTO & Technical Leadership

**Industry**: eCommerce / Direct-to-Consumer Alcohol
**Engagement**: 5 years (2019–2024)
**Role**: Chief Technology Officer

## The Challenge

BlackSquare operated a complex portfolio of 55+ ecommerce sites serving global alcohol brands—including Johnnie Walker, Vivino, and Malts.com—alongside owned brands like Wine Collective, Canada Craft Club, and Kwaf. The company was growing fast but lacked the technical foundation to scale: fragmented data across platforms, inconsistent customer experiences, no unified analytics, and compliance gaps across multiple jurisdictions (GDPR in Europe, PCI for payments, provincial regulations in Canada).

## Our Approach

As CTO, I built the technical organisation and infrastructure to support hypergrowth—scaling the team from 10 to nearly 100 while maintaining delivery velocity. Rather than treating each site as an island, we engineered a unified data and retail platform that gave the business a single view across all properties.

Key initiatives:
- **Unified Data Platform**: Built insightplatform.ai, a cross-platform data layer aggregating customer, inventory, and transaction data from 55+ storefronts
- **AI-Powered Retail Stack**: Deployed tools for optimised SEO, intelligent search, product discovery, and personalised recommendations
- **Compliance-First Architecture**: Designed systems for SOC2, GDPR, and PCI compliance from the ground up; served as Global Data Privacy Officer
- **Engineering Transformation**: Modernised DevOps and MLOps frameworks, building internal tooling that let the team scale efficiently

## Key Deliverables

- **insightplatform.ai**: Enterprise data platform providing unified analytics across all DTC operations
- **Scalable Team**: Multidisciplinary engineering organisation (design, development, IT, data engineering, product management)
- **Compliance Certifications**: SOC2, GDPR, and PCI compliance achieved
- **DevOps/MLOps Infrastructure**: Modern CI/CD pipelines and ML operations framework

## Impact

- **#166 Fastest-Growing Company in Canada** (Globe and Mail, 2021)
- **260% three-year revenue growth**, reaching $25M annual revenue
- **10→100 team scale** across all technical disciplines
- **55+ ecommerce properties** unified under a single data platform
- **Global compliance** achieved across Canadian, US, and European jurisdictions
