# Zane Money: Fractional CTO & AI Architecture

**Industry**: Fintech / Gen-Z Banking
**Engagement**: Ongoing (2024–present)
**Role**: Advisor / Fractional CTO

## The Challenge

Zane Money set out to build something traditional banks couldn't: an AI-powered banking platform that helps Gen-Z users save $500+ monthly through hyper-personalised budgeting and financial guidance. The founding team had the vision and domain expertise, but needed senior technical leadership to build the foundational architecture—particularly around AI, security, and regulatory compliance—without the runway to hire a full-time CTO.

## Our Approach

As Fractional CTO, I'm building the technical foundation for a platform that combines banking, AI-powered budgeting, and voice-first interaction. This includes architecting secure AI systems that handle sensitive financial data while meeting the compliance bar required for chartered banking operations.

Key initiatives:
- **AI Financial Advisor Architecture**: Designed dual-LLM security architecture with LangGraph for the chat-based banking assistant
- **Banking Infrastructure**: Architected integration with DC Bank partnership, Plaid/Fingoal for account aggregation, and Persona for KYC
- **Compliance Foundation**: Guiding SOC 2 Type 2 certification (via Vanta), PCI readiness, and FinTRAC compliance for Canadian operations
- **Team & Process**: Building scalable development team and establishing engineering practices to move fast while meeting financial services quality bar

## Key Deliverables

- **AI Chat System**: Voice and text financial advisor with 10-12 second response times
- **Mobile Platform**: React Native iOS/Android app with real-time WebSocket updates
- **Banking Integration**: Account aggregation, virtual/physical card management, real-time budgeting
- **Security Architecture**: AES-256 encryption, ISO 27001 alignment, SOC 2 certification pathway
- **Development Velocity**: 4-month MVP timeline vs. competitor's 18-month build with larger team

## Impact

- **$500-700/month user savings** projected vs. traditional bank's $10-50 cashback
- **4-month development cycle** from concept to TestFlight deployment
- **SOC 2 Type 2 certification** in progress
- **DC Bank approval pathway** established for production banking services
- **FDIC/CDIC protected** operations under chartered bank licenses

## Technologies

React Native, Google Kubernetes Engine, PostgreSQL, WebSockets, LangGraph, dual-LLM architecture, Plaid, Persona KYC, Vanta (SOC 2), DC Bank integration
