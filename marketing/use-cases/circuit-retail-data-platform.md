# Circuit: Retail Data Platform & AI Architecture

**Industry**: Retail Technology / Data Platform
**Engagement**: Ongoing (2024–present)
**Role**: Co-Founder / CTO

## The Challenge

Retailers using third-party delivery platforms (Instacart, DoorDash, Uber Eats) lose significant revenue to pricing mismatches, out-of-stock substitutions, and weight discrepancies—but reconciling millions of transactions manually is impractical. Beyond reconciliation, mid-to-large retailers lack the data infrastructure to collaborate securely with partners, share insights, or prepare for AI-driven analytics. They need enterprise data capabilities without enterprise budgets.

## Our Approach

Circuit is built on the first Retail Language Model (RLM)—a domain-specific AI trained on retail transaction patterns. The platform serves two core functions: automated discrepancy recovery that turns leaked revenue into found money, and a secure data collaboration layer that lets retailers share insights without exposing raw data.

Key initiatives:
- **AI-Powered Reconciliation**: ML matching engine that reconciles POS logs with platform transaction logs, identifying pricing mismatches, substitutions, and weight discrepancies
- **Retail Language Model**: Domain-specific AI trained on retail patterns for natural language queries against transaction data
- **Trust Layer Architecture**: Local encryption and tokenization before data transmission, enabling secure cross-party collaboration
- **Compliance-First Design**: HIPAA and SOC 2 compliance via Carbide partnership, with granular permissions and audit reporting

## Key Deliverables

- **1099-K Reconciliation Service**: Automated discrepancy detection with evidence packets for platform disputes
- **Unified Data Platform**: BigQuery direct connection supporting both raw and RLM-processed data views
- **Secure Collaboration Layer**: Encrypted data sharing with granular access controls
- **Order Ledger Reports**: Confidence-scored discrepancy reports showing expected vs. actual amounts

## Impact

- **Success-based pricing**: Retailers keep 75% of recovered funds (no upfront cost)
- **75% cost reduction** vs. Snowflake for equivalent data platform capabilities
- **$1K-$10K platform cost** vs. $100K+ traditional data lake implementations
- **Target: $300K-$500K ARR** from initial 2-5 enterprise customers
- **Enterprise clients**: Platform built on experience with MasterCard, Coca-Cola, Instacart, Fiserv, US Bank

## Technologies

Retail Language Model (RLM), BigQuery, ML transaction matching, local encryption/tokenisation, SOC 2/HIPAA compliance, POS integration, third-party delivery platform APIs (Instacart, DoorDash, Uber Eats)
