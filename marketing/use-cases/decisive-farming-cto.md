# Decisive Farming: CTO & Technical Leadership

**Industry**: Agricultural Technology / Precision Farming
**Engagement**: 2 years (2013–2014)
**Role**: Chief Technology Officer

## The Challenge

Modern farming generates vast amounts of data—from satellite imagery and soil sensors to equipment telemetry and weather patterns—but most farmers had no practical way to turn that data into better decisions. Decisive Farming aimed to change that: build a platform that combines precision agronomics, crop marketing, and farm management into a single system. The challenge was taking an early-stage concept and building both the technology and the team to make it real.

## Our Approach

As CTO, I established the technical foundation for what would become a category-defining agtech platform. This meant building from scratch: establishing the Calgary office, creating development processes, and growing the engineering team while simultaneously shipping product.

Key initiatives:
- **Next-Generation Farm Platform**: Led development of the web application that unified variable rate application, crop marketing tools, and farm management in one place
- **Equipment Integration**: Ran R&D projects integrating farm data equipment from OEMs including John Deere and Case New Holland
- **Mobile Field Extensions**: Built mobile applications enabling farmers to access insights and capture data directly in the field
- **Agile Transformation**: Created development workflows and agile processes that allowed a small team to move fast without breaking things

## Key Deliverables

- **Farm Management Platform**: Web application bringing precision agronomics, crop marketing, and data management together
- **OEM Integrations**: Data pipelines connecting equipment telemetry to the platform
- **Mobile Applications**: Field-ready tools for on-farm data capture and decision support
- **Scalable Team**: Engineering organisation built from 2 to 10 full-time developers

## Impact

- **$2M → $5M revenue growth** during tenure
- **2 → 10 person engineering team** built from the ground up
- **ASTech Award** for Innovation in Agricultural Science (2014)
- **TechVibes Most Promising Startup** (2014)
- **Acquired by TELUS** in 2019, now core to TELUS Agriculture alongside Agrian and Farm At Hand

## Technologies

Precision agriculture, variable rate application, satellite imagery, sensor integration, OEM data pipelines (John Deere, Case New Holland), web platform development, mobile applications
