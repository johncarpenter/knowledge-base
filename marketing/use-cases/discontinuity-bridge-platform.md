# Discontinuity.ai: Bridge Platform

**Category**: AI Platform / Internal Product
**Development**: Ongoing (launched 2024)
**Role**: Full Product Development

## The Challenge

Organisations eager to adopt AI face a difficult trade-off: move fast with uncontrolled tools, or move slowly while building compliant infrastructure. Shadow AI proliferates when teams can't access sanctioned solutions, creating security blind spots. Meanwhile, vendor lock-in and fragmented billing across multiple AI providers add cost and complexity.

## Our Approach

Bridge is a unified, web-based AI workspace built for **controlled, scalable AI adoption**. It gives teams the freedom to experiment while giving leadership the governance they need—centralised access controls, audit trails, and data policies that ensure corporate information stays protected. Built on the principle of "invest in ideas, not tools," Bridge abstracts away infrastructure complexity without sacrificing security or compliance.

## Key Deliverables

- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Drag-and-drop interface for building complex AI flows without code
- **Native RAG Integration**: Secure retrieval-augmented generation that keeps corporate data within controlled boundaries
- **Multi-Model Access**: Single governed interface to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Cohere, Mistral, and AWS Bedrock
- **Enterprise Controls**: Role-based access, usage policies, and audit logging for compliance requirements
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared models, data sources, and workflows with appropriate permissions
- **Consolidated Billing**: One subscription replaces multiple AI vendor contracts, with full visibility into usage

## Impact

- **Controlled AI Adoption**: Organisations can enable AI across teams without sacrificing security posture
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Switch models without re-engineering workflows—flexibility without technical debt
- **Reduced Time-to-Value**: Non-technical domain experts can prototype and deploy AI solutions independently
- **Compliance-Ready**: Built-in governance supports enterprise security and data handling requirements

## Technologies

Multi-LLM orchestration, RAG pipelines, visual workflow engine, role-based access control, audit logging, AWS infrastructure, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini
