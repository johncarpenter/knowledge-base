Discontinuity.ai Ventures – Background & Rationale

(Internal briefing for investors, advisors, and team members)

⸻

1. Strategic Pivot
	•	From: Boutique AI consulting + ad-hoc product building.
	•	To: AI venture studio that co-develops startups alongside solo founders or domain experts.
	•	Reason: Founder-led AI companies frequently stall for lack of three resources at once—senior engineering, AI know-how, and early capital. Discontinuity.ai Ventures supplies all three, plus a ready-made partner network, closing “the missing piece” gap.

2. Venture-Studio Model in Brief

Attribute	Venture Studio	Traditional VC	Consultancy
Core asset	Hands-on product team + seed capital	Capital only	Billable expertise
Engagement depth	Acts as co-founder (CTO, product, go-to-market)	Advisory / board	Project-based
Revenue path	Equity in each venture; optional service fees	Carry + management fees	Fees
Time to cash-flow	Medium (early exits possible)	Long (7-10 yrs)	Immediate
Key risk	Operating bandwidth	Market cycles	Dependency on billable hours

Well-known analogues: Betaworks, Atomic, AI Fund—all demonstrate that concentrated, repeatable company-building can outperform scatter-shot angel investing.

3. Niche Value Proposition
	1.	Technical backing – Studio team functions as fractional CTO + engineering squad from day 0.
	2.	Deep AI expertise – Proven frameworks for LLMs, agents, data pipelines, compliance.
	3.	Flexible funding – Studio capital plus sweat-equity options; ability to syndicate follow-on rounds.
	4.	Portfolio network – Cross-company pilots, shared talent, preferred vendors, warm investor intros.

4. Why Now (Market Context)
	•	AI build costs plummeting – Off-the-shelf models and tooling let small teams ship enterprise-grade ML with 10× less capital.
	•	Talent mismatch – Domain experts abound; senior AI engineers remain scarce and expensive.
	•	Corporate appetite for acquisition – Incumbents are actively buying niche AI tech (“acqui-hires”) to accelerate adoption.
	•	Studio momentum – Global venture-studio count grew from ~65 (2015) to >780 (2022); AI-focused studios form the fastest-growing subset.

5. Portfolio & Synergies (as of Q2 2025)

Company	Sector	Studio Role	Strategic Fit
CircuitAI	Retail data marketplace	Seed $, co-dev	Data pipelines reused across ventures
ZaneMoney	Gen-Z fintech	CTO, seed $	LLM-based recommendation engine reusable in others
JotLabs	Dev-tools / migration	Spin-out, equity	Shared infra + security playbooks
OmelaHealth	Voice-first med-tech	Hardware / AI lead, equity	Speech models feed into future health ventures
RunBoard	Agentified task mgr	Majority share	Core agent framework → other startups
Bridge Platform	Internal AI workspace	Proprietary	In-house “operating system” for all builds

6. Operating Playbook
	1.	Discovery (2–4 wks) – Validate problem with target customers; rapid Figma/Notion prototypes.
	2.	MVP Build (≤ 12 wks) – Leverage Bridge templates; shared DevSecOps; regulatory checklist if required.
	3.	Launch & Iterate (6-18 mos) – Growth experiments, onboarding first paying customers.
	4.	Scale / Exit – Raise external round or arrange strategic acquisition; studio retains meaningful equity (typically 20–40 %).

⸻

7. Monetisation & Economics
	•	Equity upside – Primary return through exits or significant follow-on rounds.
	•	Selective service fees – Optional; used sparingly to cover burn without diluting founders.
	•	Syndicate carry – For external deals the studio does not co-found but does advise.

Target portfolio cadence: 1–2 new ventures per year, balancing depth with bandwidth.

⸻

8. Competitive Differentiation
	•	Full-stack AI competence uncommon among studios; most offer product/design but outsource ML.
	•	Existing complementary portfolio creates immediate synergies and cross-sell potential.
	•	Canadian base unlocks government grants (IRAP, SR&ED), reducing effective burn for ventures.

⸻

9. Key Risks & Mitigations

Risk	Mitigation
Bandwidth as a solo GP	Limit concurrent builds; recruit fractional specialists; leverage AI tooling.
Capital constraints	Stage-gate funding; co-investor syndicates; occasional high-margin consulting.
Portfolio concentration	Diverse vertical focus (fintech, health, retail, dev-tools) hedges sector risk.

10. Next Milestones
	1.	Public launch of Discontinuity.ai Ventures site + announcement blog post.
	2.	Close first external Founder-in-Residence deal (target Q3 2025).
	3.	Formalise angel syndicate or micro-fund vehicle to scale cheque size.
	4.	Secure at least one strategic pilot or exit opportunity within existing portfolio by mid-2026.
