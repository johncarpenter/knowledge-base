## Yesterday's Meetings (Feb 9)

### ClickUp Migration & Operations Setup
**Date:** Feb 9, 2026 11:31 PM | **Attendees:** John

**Summary:** Successfully migrating from JIRA to ClickUp with focused daily board reviews. Setting up separate Operations space for SOC2 compliance, infrastructure, and customer support.

**Key Decisions:**
- Moving completely from JIRA to ClickUp for all project management
- PostHog will handle all analytics - don't build analytics into custom dashboard

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Focus on MVP backend bucket and chat experience epic as primary work areas

---

### 1:1 with Darren
**Date:** Feb 9, 2026 9:00 PM | **Attendees:** John, Darren

**Summary:** Strategic planning discussion identifying app modernization as biggest market opportunity, targeting legacy apps on "life support." Discussed AER opportunity (140 contract IT staff, tens of millions budget).

**Key Decisions:**

### Weekly Team Sync
**Date:** Feb 9, 2026 4:15 PM | **Attendees:** John

- [ ] Alexi: Transactions module assignment
