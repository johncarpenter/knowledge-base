## Summary

Introductory call with Liam (master's student) to discuss potential data science projects for his master's program. Reviewed multiple project opportunities across different clients including automated cleaning (Nano), Jot Internal Gen AI, Circuit Pay reconciliation, Zane Money, and HQA (Health Quality Alberta).

## Key Decisions

- Liam interested in Circuit Pay (matches current project experience with heterogeneous data reconciliation)
- Mixed feelings about image recognition due to previous burnout with data augmentation
- Preference for projects with validated datasets
- Open to multiple project combination for 200-hour requirement
- AI coding tools strongly encouraged and supported

## Action Items

- [ ] Liam: Consult master's advisor about project requirements and multi-project feasibility
- [ ] John: Provide project write-ups for advisor presentation
- [ ] John: Follow up on HQA meeting (next Tuesday) for timeline clarity
- [ ] John: Check on Circuit Pay client response
- [ ] John: Send AI Tinkerers invite to Liam

## Notes

### Available Data Science Projects

**1. Automated Cleaning (Nano Device)**
- Camera-mounted water sprayer for industrial tank cleaning (oil/gas)
- Image recognition system to identify spray targets and patterns
- Challenge: Limited data, may need to create synthetic datasets
- Concerns about data validation without ground truth
- Current approach: Canny edge detection focusing on texture differences
- Short engagement, unlikely to reach 200 hours

**2. Jot Internal Gen AI/LLM Project**
- Building agentic approach for Gen AI tool deployment
- RAG system implementation for multiple clients
- Focus on easy deployment and agent development
- More implementation-focused, less strict data science

**3. Circuit Pay Reconciliation**
- Doordash/Instacart order reconciliation with POS systems
- 2-3% gap on $300M annual volume (significant revenue impact)
- ML clustering to find non-exact matches between different SKU sets
- Payment model: 25% of recovered revenue
- Similar to Liam's current project with heterogeneous data reconciliation

**4. Zane Money (Gen Z Banking)**
- AI-powered chat interface for banking
- Automated budget creation from spending history
- Transaction classification (entertainment, groceries, subscriptions)
- Forward-thinking spending projections
- Led by PhD-level data scientist

**5. HQA (Health Quality Alberta)**
- Patient satisfaction and outcome data analysis
- Doctor performance comparison and improvement recommendations
- Government contract with substantial funding
- Longer approval process due to health data requirements
- End of Q3 timeline

### Project Preferences & Considerations
- Student interested in Circuit Pay (matches current project experience)
- Mixed feelings about image recognition due to previous burnout with data augmentation
- Preference for projects with validated datasets
- Open to multiple project combination for 200-hour requirement
- AI coding tools strongly encouraged and supported

### Next Steps
- Student to consult master's advisor about project requirements and multi-project feasibility
- John to provide project write-ups for advisor presentation
- John to follow up on HQA meeting (next Tuesday) for timeline clarity
- Circuit Pay client response pending
- Option for student-owned IP project with mentorship support
