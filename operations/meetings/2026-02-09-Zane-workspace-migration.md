## Summary

### Project Management System Migration

- Moving from JIRA to ClickUp for better workflow management
- All existing tickets being ported over with current status
- John's items mostly in review status - essentially caught up
- Only "to do" items need migration to new system

### ClickUp Structure & Organization

- Zain MVP as main initiative with focused daily board reviews
- Two primary work areas for John:
  - MVP backend bucket
  - Chat experience epic
- Flexible ticket creation approach - prioritizing speed over rigid structure
- Backlog system for future items not part of MVP scope

### Operations Space Setup

- John creating separate Operations space for non-build work
  - SOC2 compliance tracking (100+ checkmarks)
  - Infrastructure management
  - Customer support workflows
- Operations runs differently than build projects - no sprint methodology
- Team security training required as part of compliance

### Dashboard Development Priorities

- PostHog handling all analytics across the board
  - Don't build analytics into custom dashboard
  - Growth/retention metrics through PostHog
- Admin dashboard needs core capability:
  - Drag users through entire setup process offline
  - Create/modify/manage user accounts and wallets
  - Enable backend support when mobile fails
- External provider status monitoring (DC Bank, Block, etc.)
- Dan completing user CRUD functionality - first iteration done

## Action Items

- [ ] Team meeting tomorrow to prioritize dashboard modules (High/medium/low priority ranking)
- [ ] John transitioning to new ticket system for all future work
- [ ] Discovery needed on "drag through system" requirements
- [ ] Sprint methodology discussion with ClickUp team ongoing
