## Summary

Discussion on Chat Module Development Strategy for Zane Money app. Focus on MVP approach where "anything you can do in the app, you can do in the chat." Black box implementation where AI decides workflow and team focuses on building tools.

## Key Decisions

- Switched from OpenAI to Vertex AI smaller model (20B parameters) - faster performance, near-zero memory usage
- Each tool may use different models based on complexity (budgeting/planning needs more expensive models)
- Voice-to-text deferred to separate module running on Cloudflare using Mistral VoxTrel API
- Session management: each chat stored as input/output conversation history with session IDs
- MVP scope: enable all mobile app functionality through chat interface

## Action Items

- [ ] Bryce: Create strategy document listing all chat-enabled features (end of week/early next week)
- [ ] Bryce: Review with Pavel for use case coverage
- [ ] Bryce: Identify visual module requirements
- [ ] John: Continue tool development and testing infrastructure
- [ ] Pavel: Work on PG4 settings (separate discussion)

## Notes

### Technical Architecture
- Vertex AI smaller model (20B parameters) - faster, near-zero memory
- Chained requests with each tool potentially using its own model
- Budgeting/planning tools need more expensive models

### Voice-to-Text
- Deferred to separate module on Cloudflare
- Mistral VoxTrel API identified as preferred solution
- Waiting for Vertex integration
- 1GB download too large for mobile device
- Audio storage required per specifications

### Chat Session Management
- Each chat stored as input/output conversation history
- Mobile passes session ID to continue existing chats
- No session ID creates new chat with new ID
- Users can return to any previous session

### Implementation Requirements
- Document all banking/budgeting features for chat access
- Define tools (API calls) vs intents (user goals)
- One intent may require multiple tool calls

### UI Integration Needs
- Trigger UI flows - redirect to app sections
- Embedded charts/tables within chat
- Large data summaries with "click for more" links
- Component rendering beyond text responses

### Security Measures
- Blue teaming: verify correct, high-quality answers
- Red teaming: prevent data extraction outside guardrails
- Agent performance monitoring (speed, cost, accuracy)
- Content filtering for inappropriate requests
