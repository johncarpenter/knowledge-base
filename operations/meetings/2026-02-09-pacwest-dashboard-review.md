## Summary

### Dashboard Progress Review

- P&L statements and balance sheets fully operational
  - Pick company → select specific report → regenerates in Excel format
  - Saves time vs manually reviewing P&L statements
- Company views more useful than expected for long-term planning
  - Shows revenue spikes and one-time income patterns
  - Limited data sets but provides valuable insights
- ANR report cleanup in progress
  - Switching from individual periods to company-based reports
  - Accommodates multiple form submissions (including reissued/bonus forms)

### Outstanding Development Items

- Net profit integration needed for company dashboard
  - Monthly net profit calculations
  - Annual net profit (annualized)
  - EBITDA calculations deferred until net profit complete
- ANR reports final cleanup
  - Expected completion today
  - Will mesh with existing dashboard structure

### Process Automation

- Moving from manual email processing to automated system
  - New dedicated email address for submissions
  - Eliminates waiting for manual drag-and-drop processing
  - Backend automation handles all processing
- Kendall will handle any pushback from portfolio companies

### Implementation Benefits

- Consolidates scattered information from Dropbox folders and independent servers
- Quick access tool for board meetings and discussions
- Report sharing capabilities (PDF, subscriptions, links)
- Won't be used 100 times/month but valuable when needed

## Key Decisions

- Net profit before EBITDA calculations
- Use new dedicated email for automated submissions
