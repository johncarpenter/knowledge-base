## Summary

### Company Vision & Market Opportunity

- App modernization identified as biggest market opportunity
  - Legacy apps on "life support" across most companies
  - AI tools enable faster, cheaper analysis (previously $30-40k, 2-month process)
  - Can provide concrete recommendations including cloud migration strategy
- Target client profile: medium-large companies with valuable legacy apps
  - Must have development teams or significant internal apps
  - Non-tech companies preferred (tech companies try to do it themselves)
  - Energy sector promising - mix of custom apps and off-shelf integrations

### Organizational Structure Recommendations

- Proposed 3-team model: Build, Operate, Analyze
  - Build: combines app dev + cloud (too integrated to separate)
  - Operate: ongoing maintenance and support
  - Analyze: data integration, ERP folded into larger data group
- Current cloud/app dev separation creates inefficiencies
  - DevOps should be part of developer group
  - Infrastructure as code means both teams writing code

### AI Adoption & Technical Capabilities

- Team adoption slow due to client approval barriers
  - No standardized policies for AI tool usage
  - NDAs require case-by-case approval for code analysis
- Proposed solution: standardized AI policy in contracts
  - James working on local models to keep data on-premises
  - Enterprise Claude doesn't train on client data
- Scaling capability strong with proper guardrails
  - Can deploy code changes in 3 minutes
  - Full infrastructure rebuild in 1 hour
  - Quality maintained through AI-assisted development

### AER Opportunity & Resource Planning

- 140 contract IT staff, tens of millions in digital transformation budget
- Richard Hanna (new CIO) wants local shop, not big consulting firm
- Current team at capacity: Jake, Daryl, Brian all full-time for next 6 months
- John available for additional 15-20 hours/week if needed
- Scaling approach: set up organizational processes first, then staff with proper guardrails

## Key Decisions

- App modernization is biggest market opportunity
- Proposed 3-team model: Build, Operate, Analyze
- Need standardized AI policy in contracts

## Action Items

- [ ] Continue developing app modernization service offering
- [ ] Work on standardized AI policy for client contracts
- [ ] Prepare for AER opportunity discussions
