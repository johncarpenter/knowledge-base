# CIR-4: Cancel Fivetran for 5 days

Temporarily pause or disable Fivetran data sync connectors for a 5-day period.

## Notes

- Ensure no critical business processes depend on real-time data during this period
- Document any data gaps that may need backfilling after re-enablement
- Consider running a manual sync before pausing to ensure data is current

## Local Notes

_Add context, decisions, blockers here._
