# CIR-2: Revise chat UX

## Description

### Overview

Improve the chat user experience to enhance usability, visual appeal, and overall user satisfaction with the conversational interface.

### Tasks

- Audit current chat UX and identify pain points
- Review message display, input areas, and interaction patterns
- Improve visual hierarchy and readability of messages
- Enhance loading states and typing indicators
- Optimize mobile responsiveness
- Review and improve error message presentation
- Consider accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Areas to Evaluate

- **Message Layout**: Bubble styling, timestamps, sender identification
- **Input Experience**: Text area behavior, send button, keyboard shortcuts
- **Feedback**: Loading indicators, delivery confirmation, error states
- **Navigation**: Scrolling behavior, message history, jump to latest
- **Visual Design**: Colors, spacing, typography, animations

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Current UX issues documented with severity ratings
- [ ] Design improvements proposed and reviewed
- [ ] Changes implemented and tested across browsers
- [ ] Mobile experience validated
- [ ] User feedback incorporated if available

### Technical Considerations

- Ensure changes maintain performance (smooth scrolling, fast rendering)
- Consider component reusability for consistency
- Test with various message lengths and types
- Validate accessibility compliance
